# Task Description:  API-INTEGRATION

# Weather & News Application  Using API

## Project Overview:

  The Weather & News App is a responsive web application that allows users to:

      Search real-time weather information for any city worldwide.

      View top headlines from the searched location‚Äôs country.

      Integrates external REST APIs to dynamically fetch and display relevant weather and news content.

      This app provides users with a unified interface to stay informed about both the climate and current affairs.

## Technologies Used:

    HTML5 & CSS3 ‚Äì for structuring and styling the UI.

    JavaScript (ES6) ‚Äì to handle API calls and dynamic data rendering.

    WeatherAPI ‚Äì for live weather data (http://api.weatherapi.com).

    GNews API ‚Äì for fetching recent news headlines (https://gnews.io).

    Responsive Design ‚Äì using media queries for mobile/tablet compatibility.

## APIs Used:
### 1. WeatherAPI

---Endpoint: /v1/current.json

--- Provides: temperature, condition, wind speed, humidity, weather icons, etc.

### 2. GNews API

--- Endpoint: /v4/top-headlines

--- Provides: news title, image, description, and article link by country.

## Key Features:
### üîé City-Based Search
Enter any city name to fetch its live weather conditions and related national news.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Real-Time Weather Info
Displays temperature, humidity, condition (sunny, cloudy, etc.), and wind speed with an icon.

### üì∞ Live News Headlines
Shows top 5 news articles (title, image, and short description) from that country.

### üí° Auto Country Mapping
Automatically maps the searched city‚Äôs country to a valid ISO code for news API usage.

#### üì± Fully Responsive UI
Optimized layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.


## How It Works:
  User enters a city name.

  WeatherAPI is called to fetch weather details.

  The country name from weather data is used to find the ISO country code.

  GNews API is called using that country code to fetch top headlines.

  Both weather and news are displayed side-by-side in a clean layout.
